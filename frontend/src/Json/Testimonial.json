      "likedAboutService": "Firstly, I liked the fact that you (Harihar) as the founder did not assign someone to coordinate with us while we approached you. Instead you were present throughout in all the meetings, listening to all our requirements and discussions. Second I liked the seamless transition between Drumil and Hemanshu. I did not have to repeat anything to Hemanshu as he was already well briefed by Drumil. Third, I was very impressed by the fact that the project was completed well within the timeline. Also one point I would like to mention, is that I was given an update almost every day about what has been done, and this made it easier to implement any changes when needed. I also liked your website, it has been done really well. Kudos!",
